\section{Button is pressed, calling elevator to floor}
-Button module detects the button press\\
-Button module alerts main module of the press\\
-Main checks to see if order already exists in system\\
    \tab -if already exsists: make sure light on button is on and exit routine.\\
    \tab -if not: continue routine\\
-Main checks to see if order is internal:\\
   \tab  -if order is internal: add order as local in Orders module, turn on light and exit routine\\
    \tab -if order is external: continoue routine\\
-Add order as global locally in Orders module and adds timestamp\\
-Make sure light for button is on\\
-Request cost of order from other nodes and wait for answer\\
-Calculate cost of order for current node and choose executing node based on costs calculated and recieved\\
   \tab  -If cost lowest on local node: add order as local in Orders module\\
    \tab -If cost lowest on external node:  Delegate order to external node\\

\section{External node requests cost for Order}
-Main module recieves request\\
-Main module adds order as global in Orders module\\
-Main calculates cost based on orders in Orders module\\
-Main sends back its cost to the requesting node\\

\section{External node delegates order}
-Main recieves delegation\\
-Main adds order as local to Orders module\\

\section{Node starts up}
-Main calls all init() functions\\
-Elevator init() makes elevator go to top floor\\
-Elevator goes down to all floors, stops and opens door at each\\
-Elevator alerts Main that startup is complete\\

\section{Elevator stops at floor and opens door}
-Elevator module alerts Main that elevator is stopping at floor\\
-Main calls clearOrders(floor) in Orders module\\
-Main calls sendClearOrders(floor) in network interface\\

\section{Elevator state machine operation}
-If orders exist in the direction elevator is already going: keep going\\
-If no orders exist: stop at next floor\\
-If orders only exist opposite of direction of travel: turn around\\
-If elevator reaches floor with orders either internal or in direction of travel: stop and open door\\
-If elevator reaches top or bottom floor: Stop and open door if orders exist\\
-If elevator is stopped: check for orders: if found go there: else stay stopped\\

\section{Global order times out}
-Main notices timeout\\
-Main adds order as local in Orders module\\
